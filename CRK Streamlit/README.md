# MCSquare-P3-Streamlit
Attempt to run demo with streamlit
 Couple things...you need to add a file named:  .secrets.toml  to run this should have your API code, or hard code in py files.  I have it in a folder called .streamlit
 I've had to move things around manually to get it to work correctly on my desktop for local hosting. 
 Add your own OpenAI Key.
 Here is what the file struction looks like in vs code: 

#folder .streamlit

  #files  secrets.toml 
  
#Folder Pages/pages

  #Folder Logo
  
    #File TravelProLogo.png
    
  #Folder pages
  
    #file 1_airbnb_demo.py

    #file 2_restaurant_demo.py
    
    #file 3_site_seeing_demo.py
    
  #File OpeningPage.py

  Just A Note, to get the pages to work from the opening page, you save them with the name Pages/pages_1_airbnb_demo.py   (They auto populate.)
